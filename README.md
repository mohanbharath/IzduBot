# IzduBot

## Intro

IzduBot is a Discord bot that makes it more feasible and simple to run campaigns via Discord. Currently rolls dice, maintains (some) character sheet information, and integrates character-related rolls (like attack rolls and initiative rolls) with stored stats and info.

  - Character lookup
    - e.g. lookup a character's passive perception to see if they notice something without cluing them in that they may be supposed to notice something
  - Initiative tracking
  - Monster stat blocks
    - Currently only planned for individual sessions (with temporary storage), may eventually be extended to permanent storage
  - Monster rolls
    - e.g. attack or save rolls
    - Would be implemented alongside or after monster stat blocks
- Character Features
  - Roll modifiers
    - e.g. your DM might give you a +3 to hit or save because of circumstances
  - Roll advantage/disadvantage
    - e.g. you might have advantage on certain skill or attack rolls as part of your class features, or because the DM said so

## FAQ

### Why doesn't IzduBot auto-fill hit dice, spell stats, and other class-related information?
IzduBot could do that, and that might actually clean up a lot of the code. However, that comes at the cost of making it unusable for those running custom/homebrew classes. IzduBot is intended to make life easier for DMs, not harder, and potentially locking out homebrew settings seemed too excluding. This might be a feature in future, however, where the SRD classes are included by default, and DMs can add homebrew classes for their own campaigns.

### Why doesn't IzduBot have more functionality for spells?
As with the above regarding class-related information, while I could do that, there are again pitfalls with homebrew settings, and as with class-related information, it might be added as a feature in future, where SRD spells are included, and DMs can add their own homebrew spells.

### Why doesn't IzduBot have [X Feature]?
If I haven't listed the feature above as planned or in the FAQ, there are a number of possible reasons: the feature might be too difficult or tedious to implement at present, the feature might pose problems for homebrewers, or I may just not have thought of the feature at all yet. Feel free to let me know - if you think a feature would be useful, either as a player or DM, I'm interested in hearing about it, or I might tell you why it's not on the table.

## Troubleshooting
Try enclosing any text (like ability names, character names, etc) in quotes "like so", and if it still doesn't work, check to make sure your command and arguments are spelled correctly and entered per the format. If you're 100% certain you're entering it correctly and it's still not working, contact me with, and I'll see what's up.
